this is a alpha version of kolaros asm edition!!
so dont expect a thing, the os is in development!!

build 19052023 (15 may 2023 build)
version 0.0.25

how to compile the os:

to compile the os just open the NASM compiler and run the "compile.bat" file with this command
in the nasm compiler: call "C:\asmkolar\compile.bat" x86
 
(you need to change the path of the command to where you have the src saved,
and you need to edit the 'compile.bat' file and you have to edit the paths to
where you have the src saved.)

when the src is compiled, just run the 'run.bat' file to run the compiled iso in QEMU!
