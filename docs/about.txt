cygwin1.dll - is a dll used by the mkisofs.exe file for convert the .bin file to a .iso file
kolar.bin - the compiled os in the .bin format, is bootable
kolar.iso - the compiled os in the .iso format, is bootable
makefile - is the makefile of the src, it doesnt work so i dont know why it is here
mkisofs.exe - is used for convert the .bin file to a .iso file

Folders:
