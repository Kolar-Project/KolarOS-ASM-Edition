this file is for explaining for what works each file of the src.

Files:

tools/build-windows.bat - is for compile the os in windows, have to be opened via NASM
tools/cygwin1.dll - is a dll used by the mkisofs.exe file for convert the .bin file to a .iso file
bin/kolar.bin - the compiled os in the .bin format, is bootable
bin/kolar.iso - the compiled os in the .iso format, is bootable
bin/kolar.flp - the compiled os in the .flp format, i dont know if it is bootable
tools/mkisofs.exe - is used for convert the .bin file to a .iso file in windows with the .bat file

Folders:
